# Finger Chopsticks AI

This project is an interactive web implementation of the classic hand game "Finger Chopsticks" (also known as Chopsticks or Stick Fingers), featuring a challenging AI opponent.

## Motivation

I'm so bad at Finger Chopsticks that I built an AI to beat people for me.

## Features

- Intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- Challenging AI opponent (that hopefully beats humans better than I can)
- Animated moves for better visibility (of your imminent defeat)
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile play (lose anywhere, anytime!)

## Tech Stack

- SvelteKit
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   pnpm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal).

5. Start playing and losing to the AI!
